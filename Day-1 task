HTTP 1.1 VS HTTP 2 DIFFERENCE


HTTP - Hypertext transfer protocol.

It helps to transfer the data over internet between  client and server side.
Multiplexing is the main difference between the HTTP 1.1 and HTTP2
HTTP 1.1 have 3 TCP connections
HTTP 1.1 loads resources one after other,so if one resource can’t be loaded, it blocks all the other resources
However HTTP 2 have 1 TCP connection
It is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.


JAVASCRIPT (OBJECTS).....{ key : value};

  A javascript object is an entity having state and behaviour.
We can store several things inside an object.
For example:

Objects { key: value}
 Array
 Function


myObject = { Car : “BMW”, 
                     Color : “Black”, 
                     Model : “2023” ,
                     Type : “EV” }
